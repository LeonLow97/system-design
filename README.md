# System Design

System design refers to the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It encompasses both high-level design and detailed design, focusing on how different parts of a system interact and function together.

In software engineering interviews, system design questions typically assess a candidate's ability to think through and create scalable, robust systems. This includes considerations such as:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Understanding the problem you are solving and the needs of the users.
2. **High-Level Architecture**: Defining the overall structure, including the choice of databases, servers, and services (like microservices or monolith architecture).
3. **Component Design**: Breaking down the system into individual components and defining their responsibilities.
4. **Data Modeling**: Designing how data will be stored, accessed, and manipulated, often involving considerations for databases (SQL vs NoSQL) and caching strategies.
5. **Scalability and Reliability**: Ensuring the system can handle increased load and remain operational, often through load balancing, replication and failover strategies.
6. **Security and Compliance**: Addressing any security concerns and regulatory requirements.
7. **APIs and Interfaces**: Designing how different components or systems will communicate with each other.

A successful system design interview response should demonstrate clear thinking, a solid understanding of various technologies, and the ability to communicate complex ideas effectively. It's important to walk through your thought process, make trade-offs, and consider future scalability and maintenance.

## Key Concepts in System Design

#### 1. Scalability

**Definition**: The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources, either vertically (adding more power to existing machines) or horizontally (adding more machines). <br>
_Example_: A web application can start on a single server (vertical scaling). As user demand grows, it can distribute the load across multiple servers (horizontal scaling) using load balancers.

#### 2, Reliability

**Definition**: The ability of a system to function correctly and consistently over time, often measured by its ability to operate without failure. <br>
_Example_: A financial transaction system that processes millions of transactions daily without losing any data or causing errors is considered reliable.

#### 3. Availability

**Definition**: The proportion of time a system is operational and accessible. High availability systems are designed to minimize downtime. <br>
_Example_: A cloud services that guarantees 99.99% uptime ensures that it is available almost all the time, with planned downtime for maintenance scheduled during off-peak hours.

#### 4. Resilience

**Definition**: The ability of a system to recover quickly from failures and continue functioning. It often involves redundancy and failover mechanisms. <br>
_Example_: An online store that reroutes traffic to a backup server if the primary server fails is exhibiting resilience. This ensures users can still access the site.

#### 5. Performance

**Definition**: How well a system responds to requests and processes data. It includes metrics like latency (response time) and throughput (number of requests handled).
_Example_: A video streaming service that can deliver content with minimal buffering and quick startup times is optimized for performance.
